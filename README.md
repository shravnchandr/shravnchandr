# Hi, I'm Shravan 👋

## About Me

I'm a **Data Scientist** passionate about using AI/ML to break down barriers and make technology accessible to everyone. Inspired by projects like [Project Euphonia](https://sites.research.google/euphonia/about/), [Project Relate](https://sites.research.google/relate/), and [Project Lookout](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/lookout-android-app/), I'm driven by the potential of ML to help people with accessibility needs live more independently.

Currently at **Robert Bosch**, I build production-grade ML systems for the automotive domain—from anomaly detection models that save €150K+ annually to real-time monitoring dashboards serving 50+ users across global teams.

🎸 When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing guitar or lost in a good book.

## What I'm Working On

🤟 **Sign Language Technology** — Building tools to help people learn and translate sign language, making communication more inclusive.

🧠 **Exploring AI/ML** — Constantly learning new technologies and techniques to push the boundaries of what's possible in accessibility-focused AI.

## Featured Work

### [Progressive Sign Language Quiz](https://github.com/shravnchandr/Duolingo-ASL)
A mastery-gated learning platform inspired by Duolingo. Features dynamic level progression, three-mode quizzes, and an intelligent review queue to help users achieve sign language proficiency.

**Tech:** Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

### [Diabetic Retinopathy with XAI](https://github.com/shravnchandr/Diabetic-Retinopathy)
High-performance classifier (96% Kappa Score) for detecting diabetic retinopathy in fundus images. Integrated Grad-CAM for explainability, visualizing lesions and hemorrhages to provide transparent AI insights for medical professionals.

**Tech:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV

### [Dynamic Sign Language Translator](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAR55106.2022.9782661)
